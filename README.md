### Inspiration
As everything shifts towards the AR and VR space, we wanted to contribute by (a) creating a TikTok film with the potential for future collaboration/additions and (b) creating a space and mechanism for people to come together, be inclusive, and have a platform for AR storytelling. Effect House by TikTok was used to develop all the filters/effects for our TikTok film, and Unity was used to create the AR exhibition app.

### What it does
Our project consisted of two phases:

The first phase involved creating a film using custom AR filters and AR objects. The film is set in a world that invites TikTok users to band together to fight a familiar villain. It consists of two videos representing two storylines within this fight. The protagonists of these videos (us) begin by using two randomizer filters we created to figure out their roles in this fight (i.e. which worlds they are being summoned to) and what weapon they will use. The storylines then explore their separate narratives (which involve several other filters we created). These videos serve as examples of how other TikTok users can add to our narrative and collaborate on our film.

The 2nd phase involved building an AR app that can display the film (and the videos it is composed of) in an MR space. This app brings the TikTok-verse to the real world, allowing creators to exhibit their contributions to our film in a shared, physical space, where other users of our app can also view their work.

### How we built it
We used TikTok's Effect House to build the 8+ AR filters we used in our film. The filters gave us a way to visualize our story in the best possible way. The AR app was built on Unity and provides the viewers with the mixed reality viewing experience of viewing TikTok videos. It can be called a "TikTok Viewing Experience in AR."

### Challenges we ran into
Creating games in Effect House. Adding the ReadPlayerMe filter in Effect House.

### Future Additions
Adding spatial sound to the MR experience.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Created 8+ Unique AR filters and an MR experience in 30 hours.
